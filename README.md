<h1>Code Fellows-401 Lab 1</h1>

The following lab contains 2 modules along with matching tests.

The first module, greet, contains a single function that accepts a single argument. The function then interpolates the argument in the form:

hello "argument"!

If there is no argument given, an error is thrown.
If the argument is not a string, null is returned.


The second module, arithmetic, contains an object with 2 attached methods.
Each method requires 2 arguments.
The first method, add, returns the sum of both arguments.
The second method, sub returns the difference of both arguments.
If either method is executed without 2 arguments, or either argument is not a number, an error is thrown.
